# Assessment Methodology
## Multi-Tier Infrastructure Compromise

**Assessment Framework:** PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)  
**Supplemental Framework:** MITRE ATT&CK v14  
**Assessment Date:** October 2025

---

## Overview

This assessment followed industry-standard penetration testing methodologies to evaluate the security posture of a multi-tier corporate infrastructure. The engagement combined systematic vulnerability assessment with adversary simulation techniques to identify exploitable security weaknesses.

---

## Methodology Framework

### Primary Framework: PTES

The Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) provides a comprehensive methodology covering seven key phases:

```
1. Pre-Engagement Interactions
2. Intelligence Gathering
3. Threat Modeling
4. Vulnerability Analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post-Exploitation
7. Reporting
```

---

## Assessment Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Engagement (2 hours)

**Activities:**

- Legal agreements

---

### Phase 2: Intelligence Gathering (8 hours)

**Reconnaissance Approach:**
