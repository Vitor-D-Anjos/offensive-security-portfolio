## üéØ Engagement Framework  
[](https://github.com/Vitor-D-Anjos/offensive-security-portfolio/blob/main/network-penetration-testing/lateral-movement-assessment/methodology/README.md#-engagement-framework)  

## Professional Testing Standards  
[](https://github.com/Vitor-D-Anjos/offensive-security-portfolio/blob/main/network-penetration-testing/lateral-movement-assessment/methodology/README.md#professional-testing-standards)  

This assessment followed industry-standard penetration testing methodologies:  
- Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) - Comprehensive testing framework  
- OSSTMM - Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual  
- NIST SP 800-115 - Technical Guide to Information Security Testing  

## Rules of Engagement  
[](https://github.com/Vitor-D-Anjos/offensive-security-portfolio/blob/main/network-penetration-testing/lateral-movement-assessment/methodology/README.md#rules-of-engagement)  

| Aspect          | Specification           |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Testing Window  | Business hours (9:00-17:00)  |
| Testing Intensity | Normal operations, no DoS testing |
| Data Handling   | No exfiltration of real customer data |
| Scope           | Pre-defined IP ranges and systems |

### Network Discovery  
[](https://github.com/Vitor-D-Anjos/offensive-security-portfolio/blob/main/network-penetration-testing/lateral-movement-assessment/methodology/README.md#network-discovery)  

**Primary Tools**  
- nmap - Network mapping and service enumeration  
- masscan - Rapid port scanning  
- tcpdump - Network traffic analysis  

**Techniques**  
- TCP SYN scanning for host discovery  
- Service version detection  
- OS fingerprinting  
- Script scanning for vulnerability identification  

### Vulnerability Assessment  

Credential Testing

hydra - Network login brute-forcing
metasploit - Automated exploitation framework
custom scripts - Targeted credential attacks
Service Assessment

nmap scripting engine (NSE)
manual service interrogation
configuration file analysis

### Exploitation & Lateral Movement  

Lateral Movement Tools

impacket suite - Pass-the-hash, SMB attacks
evil-winrm - Windows Remote Management
pth-winexe - Pass-the-hash execution
ssh, scp - Secure shell for Unix systems

**Techniques**  
- Credential reuse testing  
- Pass-the-hash attacks  
- Service exploitation  
- Privilege escalation paths  

## üìä Testing Phases  

**Phase 1: Planning & Reconnaissance**

- Credential harvesting  
- Horizontal movement  
- Vertical privilege escalation  

**Phase 5: Domain Compromise**  
- Domain privilege escalation  
- Critical asset access  
- Business impact assessment  
- Cleanup activities  

**Phase 6: Reporting & Analysis**  
- Evidence documentation  
- Risk assessment  
- Remediation planning  
- Executive communication
