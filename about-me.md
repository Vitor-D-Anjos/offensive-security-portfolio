## 🎯 Summary

I'm a penetration tester focused on Active Directory security, network exploitation, and red team operations. I specialize in identifying complex attack paths, exploiting real-world misconfigurations, and delivering actionable remediation tailored to both technical and business audiences.

I combine deep technical expertise with a strong understanding of business risk—ensuring my assessments go beyond vulnerabilities to support strategic security decisions.

## 🛠️ Core Expertise

- 🔓 Active Directory exploitation & privilege escalation
- 🌐 Internal/external network penetration testing
- 🛡️ Post-exploitation & lateral movement (Pass-the-Hash, DCSync, NTLM relay)
- 📊 Security risk assessment & impact analysis
- 📝 Reporting aligned with MITRE ATT&CK & business objectives

## 🚀 What Drives Me

I approach offensive security with the mindset of an adversary and the ethics of a defender.

- 🔍 Problem Solving – Mapping and exploiting hidden AD attack paths
- 📚 Continuous Learning – Staying sharp with labs, CTFs, and threat research
- 💡 Business Impact – Translating technical findings into real-world risk
- 🤝 Knowledge Sharing – Contributing to community learning and mentoring
- 🎓 Growth-Oriented – Actively pursuing OSCP and advanced red team certs

## 💼 Experience Highlights

**Enterprise AD Security Assessments**

- Discovered and exploited escalation paths using BloodHound, Kerberoasting, AS-REP Roasting, and ACL abuse
- Achieved domain compromise and lateral movement via NTLM relay, Pass-the-Hash, and WinRM/PSExec
- Delivered remediation plans with cost/timeline estimates and detection use cases

**Key Outcomes:**

- ✅ 100% in-scope compromise rate
- ✅ $3.5M+ business impact from critical findings
- ✅ Full-chain attack simulation using MITRE ATT&CK techniques

## 📊 Methodology

I follow the PTES and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks, adapted to each environment.

- Scoping & Recon – Define goals, enumerate assets, identify vulnerabilities
- Threat Modeling – Map potential attack paths and business impact
- Exploitation – Gain access, escalate privileges, move laterally
- Post-Exploitation – Harvest credentials, establish persistence
- Reporting – Deliver technical findings + executive summaries
- Remediation Guidance – Actionable, prioritized, and measurable

## 🌟 What Sets Me Apart

  Business impact quantified ($)  
  MITRE technique mapping  
  Remediation with cost/timeline

- 💼 Business-Aligned Security  
  Vulnerabilities prioritized by risk  
  Clear communication to exec and tech audiences

- 📈 Improvement-Driven  
  Constant upskilling via labs, research, CTFs, and community engagement

- 🧭 Ethical by Design  
  Respect scope, data, and disclosure processes  
  Adhere to ISC², EC-Council, and ACM Codes of Ethics
